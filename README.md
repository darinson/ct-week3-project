# Cash-on-Cash Return on Investment Calculator for Rental Properties
## Coding Temple Week 3 Project

### Background
Return on investment (ROI) is a metric used to calculate how much total profit was gained from an investment. ROI is a simple, basic calculation that essentially shows how efficiently an investment created profit during a set period of time.

> ROI = 100 * Net Profit / Total Cost

Cash on cash ROI is a more specific metric used to show how much net cash was generated (or lost) from an investment. Net cash generated is called "cash flow" for this equation, and is equal to the net operating income minus the mortgage payment.

> Cash on Cash Return = 100 * Annual Pre-Tax Cash Flow / Actual Cash Invested

To my understanding, the concepts of the ROI and cash on cash ROI are essentially the same (what is your net gain/loss over how much you invested) - the two are simply used differently. ROI is used for long term understanding of total return on your investment, whereas Cash on Cash return is used to understand the stability of an investment - how much cash can the investment actually generate incrementally.
